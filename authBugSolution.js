To reliably handle changes in authentication state, irrespective of whether they stem from explicit user actions or internal Firebase processes, consider supplementing `onAuthStateChanged` with a mechanism for fetching the current user's authentication status periodically.  This can be achieved using `onAuthStateChanged` to initiate the initial authentication check, and then using a `setInterval` or similar timer to periodically call `firebase.auth().currentUser` to fetch and update the current authentication state. The frequency of these periodic checks can be adjusted depending on the application's requirements.
