This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  In certain situations, particularly following automatic token refreshes or admin-initiated changes to user accounts, the listener may fail to update the authentication state. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications relying on real-time authentication status. The included code showcases the problem and a possible workaround.
